#CodeAlpha_Project_Advertising_Sales_Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Sales based on the advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper. Using machine learning models, the goal is to understand how advertising spend across different channels impacts sales performance.

#Models Used:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The performance of these models is evaluated using key metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R².

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

Column	Description
TV	Budget allocated for TV advertising (in monetary units)
Radio	Budget allocated for Radio advertising (in monetary units)
Newspaper	Budget allocated for Newspaper advertising (in monetary units)
Sales	Actual sales achieved (in monetary units)
Example Data:
TV	Radio	Newspaper	Sales
230.1	37.8	69.2	22.1
44.5	39.3	45.1	10.4
17.2	45.9	69.3	9.3
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to train machine learning models to predict sales based on advertising budgets across multiple channels. The models used are evaluated on their ability to minimize error and predict sales accurately.

Machine Learning Models Used
Linear Regression

A simple regression model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features (advertising budgets) and the target variable (sales).
Decision Tree Regression

A non-linear model that uses a tree structure to make predictions based on feature values.
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A powerful model with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, ideal for modeling non-linear relationships between the features and the target.
Performance Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual sales.
R² (Coefficient of Determination): Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model.
How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeAlpha_Project_Advertising_Sales_Prediction.git
2. Install Dependencies:
Make sure Python is installed on your system, then install the required libraries by running:


pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the Models:
Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to train the models and evaluate their performance:


python train_models.py
The performance metrics for each model (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM) will be displayed in the console.

Repository Structure
The repository contains the following files and folders:

train_models.py: Python script to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
README.md: Project documentation (this file).
advertising_sales_data.csv: The dataset used in this project.
output/: Folder containing model results and performance metrics.
